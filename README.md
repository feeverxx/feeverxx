# VELMOR.COM.TR

I will briefly tell you about the Velmor project. Velmor Community is a community of gamers founded by me. Velmor's web services section includes a website project that I have developed in order to improve myself. The aim of this project is to follow a development journey of the site from top to bottom with various tools and programming languages, starting with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
